# Deep-Learning-Based-Tamper-Detection-on-Images

Tamper Detection/Forgery in Digital Images.

Get the CASIA2 from here: [CASIA2](https://www.kaggle.com/sophatvathana/casia-dataset)
Get MICC here: [MICC](http://lci.micc.unifi.it/labd/2015/01/copy-move-forgery-detection-and-localization/)

Add the datasets to the drive in path 'Colab Notebooks'/CVDatasets/ or change paths in the tamper_detection.ipynb notebook.

All the experiments and runs are there in tamper_detection.ipynb

models folder contains saved models, load and test your data on that.
